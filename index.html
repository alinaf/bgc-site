      I made this because I wanted to make a word game, but all I could find were snake tutorials. Spell out "banana", and continue tacking on alternating "n"s and "a"s. The game ends when you repeat a letter or the snake eats itself.<br><br>

      This was the first game I ever made!

      Grabble is a 2-player word game in which players make words from a communal tile bank, and can steal each other's words by adding to them and/or rearranging them. Grabble uses Heroku + Node.js!<br><br>

      To play, press the start button after you and a friend have both launched the <a href="https://scram.herokuapp.com/">site</a>.
